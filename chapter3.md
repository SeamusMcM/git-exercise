# Chapter 3

Days turned into weeks, and Peter missed his bike more than ever. He couldn't help but feel like a part of him had been taken away along with it. The once vibrant and joyful man became a shadow of his former self, consumed by bitterness and resentment.

As Peter dwelled on his loss, he realized that his stolen bike was not just a material possession â€“ it represented his freedom, his independence, and his ability to pursue happiness on his own terms. The government's actions felt like a metaphor for the crushing weight of capitalism and taxation, stripping away his autonomy and reducing him to a mere cog in a larger machine.
