# Chapter 1: Once Upon a Time

Once upon a time, in a small town nestled among rolling hills, there lived a sad little man named Benjamin. Benjamin was a simple man, content with his humble life working at the local bakery and spending his evenings tinkering with old bicycles in his garage.

One day, Benjamin decided to treat himself to a new bicycle. With great excitement, he purchased a shiny red bike from the local shop and eagerly set out to ride it around town. But as he pedaled down the streets, a group of stern-looking government officials approached him.
